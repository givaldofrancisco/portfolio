      <description>The objective of this project is to build a machine learning Cat/Dog image classifier. A system to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat will be implemented. Normalization. Images are created by pixels, each pixel represent a color dot in the imagine, and a digital image are made by number, each number is a pixel and it goes from 0 to 255 divided into 3 colors, as all images have very different tons the number are totally different, when we normalize it, we just put it in the same scale, this makes convergence faster while training the network.</description>

      <description>A lot of words, symbols and sometimes numbers are not good for prediction, actually it can have a negative effect in the algorithms, then, we need to clean as much as possible and try to get just the key words that really represent a Spam or ham email. https://github.com/givaldofrancisco/spam_detector/blob/main/Assignment%201%20-%20%20V4.ipynb</description>

      <description>The relationship between the height of the children and their parents was represented by a mathematical model, which associates the dependent variable with the independent variable, known as the simple linear regression model. This relationship between variables can occur in two ways: Using regression analysis
